# Orfid

Orfid is a public-interest reporting platform designed to help individuals
securely document concerns about public services, public authorities, and
institutional conduct — without asserting truth, blame, or outcome.

The platform exists to preserve information, context, and evidence in a
procedurally neutral way, so that concerns can be recorded responsibly and
examined by humans, not decided by systems.

## Why Orfid Exists

Many people experience harm, maladministration, or misconduct involving
public services, but find that existing routes are:

- inaccessible
- opaque
- slow
- adversarial
- or dependent on institutional goodwill

At the same time, unstructured disclosure through social media or informal
channels creates real risks:
- defamation
- misinterpretation
- loss of evidence
- escalation without due process

Orfid is designed to sit **between silence and accusation**.

It provides a place to *record*, not to judge.

## What Orfid Is (and Is Not)

**Orfid is:**
- a structured intake and preservation system
- privacy-conscious by design
- modular and auditable
- built around separation of duties
- governed by process, not opinion

**Orfid is not:**
- a court
- a regulator
- a truth engine
- an accusation platform
- an automated decision system

The platform does not determine credibility, intent, or severity.
Those judgments remain external and human.

## Platform Philosophy

Orfid is built on four core principles:

1. **Procedural neutrality**  
   The system does not decide outcomes. It preserves inputs.

2. **Evidence before interpretation**  
   Information is stored with provenance and context, without narrative
   inflation or algorithmic scoring.

3. **Privacy by minimisation**  
   Only the minimum necessary data is collected. Identity is not inferred
   or reconstructed.

4. **Human accountability**  
   All meaningful decisions remain the responsibility of people, not software.

---

## Modular Design

The platform is structured as a set of conceptually separate modules,
each with a narrowly defined role (for example: intake, structuring,
procedural review, visibility control, and compliance).

This separation is intentional.  
No single module has authority to determine meaning or outcome.

Visuals and diagrams in this repository are **illustrative only** and
do not describe executable behaviour.

## Status

Orfid is under active development.

This repository presents the **conceptual and visual design** of the platform.
Executable code, live systems, and operational logic are maintained separately.

Nothing here should be interpreted as a live service guarantee, legal advice,
or an assertion of system capability beyond design intent.

---

## Audience

This project is intended to be legible to:
- members of the public seeking safer documentation routes
- journalists and investigators evaluating system posture
- regulators and oversight bodies assessing process design
- investors interested in civic-infrastructure platforms

Clarity and restraint are deliberate.
